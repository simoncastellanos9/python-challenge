Financial Record &amp; Voter Analysis

PyBank

- This python script analyzes the financial records of my company. We are given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. This script calculates and displays the following:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

- In addition, the script both prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll

- For this challenge, we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

- We were given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Our task was to create a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:
  - The total number of votes casted
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
- In addition, the final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

  **The election_data.csv file given was too big to upload into the github repository. Had to use gitignore so that the code could still run.
